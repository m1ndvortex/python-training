# GitHub Basics: A Beginner's Guide

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is like a cloud storage service specifically designed for code. Think of it as Google Drive or Dropbox, but with special features for programmers. It allows you to:

- Store your code online
- Track changes to your code over time
- Collaborate with others
- Share your projects with the world (or keep them private)

## Important: Where Your Code Gets Uploaded

When you upload your code to GitHub:

1. **It goes to YOUR personal GitHub account** - not someone else's account
2. **You need to create your own GitHub account first** - your code isn't automatically uploaded anywhere
3. **You control who can see your code** - you can make repositories public or private

## How to Create a GitHub Account

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the "Sign up" button in the top-right corner
3. Enter your email address
4. Create a password
5. Choose a username (this will be part of your repository URLs)
6. Complete the verification puzzle
7. Click "Create account"
8. Verify your email address by clicking the link GitHub sends you

## How to Find Your Repositories After Uploading

After you've created an account and uploaded your code (following the steps in GITHUB_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md):

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
2. Sign in with your username and password
3. Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner
4. Select "Your repositories" from the dropdown menu
5. You'll see a list of all your repositories
6. Click on the repository name to view its contents

## What Your Repository Will Look Like on GitHub

When you successfully upload your repository:

1. You'll see all your files listed on the main page
2. Your README.md file will be displayed automatically below the file list
3. You can click on any file to view its contents
4. The URL will be: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME`
   (where YOUR-USERNAME is your GitHub username and REPO-NAME is what you named your repository)

## Common Questions

### "I don't see my files on GitHub"
Your files won't appear on GitHub until you complete ALL the steps in the GITHUB_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md file, including:
1. Creating a GitHub account
2. Creating a new repository on GitHub
3. Running the commands to connect your local repository to GitHub
4. Pushing your code to GitHub

### "Which GitHub account will my files be uploaded to?"
Your files will be uploaded to the GitHub account that YOU create. They won't be uploaded to anyone else's account.

### "Do I need to pay for GitHub?"
GitHub offers free accounts with unlimited public and private repositories. You only need to pay if you need advanced features.

## Next Steps

Once you've created your GitHub account and understand the basics:

1. Follow the detailed instructions in GITHUB_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md to upload your repository
2. Use NEXT_STEPS.md to understand what you can do after uploading
